# Task 3 – SQL for Data Analysis (Heart Disease Dataset)

## Overview
This project is part of the Data Analyst Internship – Task 3.
The objective of this task is to perform data analysis using SQL queries on a medical
dataset related to heart disease and extract meaningful insights.

The dataset contains patient health information such as age, gender, blood pressure,
cholesterol, heart rate, and heart disease status.

---

## Dataset Used
**Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv**

The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Blood Pressure (BP)
- Cholesterol
- Max Heart Rate
- Exercise Angina
- ST Depression
- Number of vessels fluro
- Heart Disease (Presence / Absence)

---

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- Relational Database
- CSV Dataset

---

## SQL Analysis Performed
The following analyses were performed using SQL queries:
- Displaying dataset records and previewing data
- Counting total number of patients
- Identifying patients with and without heart disease
- Calculating average age of patients with heart disease
- Analyzing heart disease distribution by gender
- Studying cholesterol and heart rate patterns
- Sorting and filtering data for deeper insights

All queries are available in the `task3_heart_disease.sql` file.

---

## Key Insights
- Patients with heart disease tend to have a higher average age.
- Male patients show a higher occurrence of heart disease compared to females.
- Cholesterol and maximum heart rate show noticeable differences between patients
  with and without heart disease.
- Exercise-induced angina is more common in patients diagnosed with heart disease.

---

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates the use of SQL for exploratory data analysis in a healthcare
context. The analysis helps in understanding patterns related to heart disease and
shows how structured queries can be used to derive actionable insights from data.
